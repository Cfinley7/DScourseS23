wages <- read.csv("wages.csv")

Drop observations where either hgc or tenure are missing
wages_clean <- na.omit(wages[, c("logwage", "hgc", "tenure", "age", "married", "college")])
As df
df_total <- data.frame(wages_clean)
Fit a linear regression model
model <- lm(logwage ~ hgc + tenure + age + married + college, data = wages_clean)

Summary table
modelsummary(model)
wages missing at .639 intercept 
logwage variable likely to be MAR


Question 7

regression using complete cases
df_final <- df_total %>% filter(!is.na(logwage))

mean imputation 
df_mean <- df_total
logwage_mean <- mean(df_mean$logwage)

imputate missing log wages
df_total <- df_final
df_total$logwage[is.na(df_mean)]<-predict(df_final,newdata=df)

#mice package
imp_data <- mice(df_final, m = 4, method = "pmm", seed = 123456)
mice <- with(imp_data,lm(logwage ~ hgc+college+age+married+tenure))

Final model summary table
model2 <- list("Final"=df_final, "Mean"=df_mean, "Predicted"=df_total, "Mice"=df_total)
modelsummary(model2)

\section{Project Update}

Overall, I have not made too much headway on the project. I have ideas and pakcages that I want to implement in my financial analysis like "fArma" and "RMetrics". I would like to use these to analzye time series data or potentially look the change of the fixed-income securities market over the past year. I might want to look into "FREDR" as well for helping and interpreting some of this data. Essentially, I have looked into numerous sources but have not yet come up with something complete for the project yet. This will change in the next couple weeks as I will put more time into this project.
